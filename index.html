        <h2>What have I being up to lately?</h2>
        
        <p> 
            
            Lately I fancied a change in my career so decided to go back into education to
            learn and harness new skills.  My first year back in education I was able 
            to pick all my own modules and study from home which is how I earned 
            my Microsoft Trainee Associates Certifications.  
            During my year I learned Python, C#, HTML with CSS and Javascript, 
            Databases, Window Server admin and Security. I also build projects 
            in the mentioned languages.  I enjoyed my learning on my own and 
            coding but felt like I was burning myself out due to taking on so 
            quickly but was grateful the National Learning Network let me enrol 
            in a Network planning course which is giving me a chance to earn 
            the new ITS certificates. 
        </p>
        <p> 
            Thanks to having great classmates and tutors my programming skills are
            continuing to improve and my tutor would be proud that I'm 
            trying to keep to the proper code conventions.  Thanks to
            the course I'm doing work placement with Circet in Letterkenny
            being trained as a network planner which involves planning out
            the network infrastructure.  In my personal time I have built 
            my own desktop computer, still working on my own projects and now
            I am designing my own NAS system as I noticed it costs €375 to buy
            a NAS with no hard drives installed so I am trying to build one for
            less than it would otherwise cost. Also my NAS system will be more
            powerful and be less limited in terms of software as I will pretty
            much be able to run whatever I want on it.

        <h2>About Me</h2>

        <p>

            I've two daughters.  Had my first job at 12 as a labourer.  
            I collected whelks, loved the peace and quite so sometimes
            worked for 10 hours a day if the tide would allow it. 
            After the day was over I carried my bag of whelks home and waited
            till I had enough and then sold them to french fisheries 
            through connections.  During my time as a labourer I also
            worked as a painter, doing interior insulation and also some 
            landscaping.  

        </p> 
        <p>
            At a young age I was curious about how devices worked so I tinkered
            with anything I could find and became a self taught repair technician.
            I've also had an urge to make my devices run better so modified android
            phones software for best performance while still being able to use 
            Google Pay now known as “Wallet”.  Also learned to use linux because 
            windows has become a bloated mess these days.  
            However I still have a strong knowledge of windows.  

        </p> 
        <p>
            
            
            My other hobbies include games, game modding, creative writing, 
            photography, sightseeing, hiking, road trips, playing and listening to music,
            drawing, watching TV shows and movies or 
            just chilling out with my children.
