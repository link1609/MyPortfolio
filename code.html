        <q> Beautiful is better than ugly.
            Explicit is better than implicit.
            Simple is better than complex.
            Complex is better than complicated.
            Flat is better than nested.
            Sparse is better than dense.
            Readability counts.
            Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
            Although practicality beats purity.
            Errors should never pass silently.
            Unless explicitly silenced.
            In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
            There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
            Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
            Now is better than never.
            Although never is often better than *right* now.
            If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
            If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
            Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those! </q>

                        Created this project as a joke, we all know we've a better chance of getting hit by lighting than winning 
                        the lottery but still I wanted to see roughly how many draws my computer would make to meet the random desired numbers, 
                        Unfortunately the desired numbers where not actually the 
                        winning numbers for the lottery but it was interesting 
                        to see randomisation used in this manner,also to see that 
                        computers are not truly random

                    This is just blackjack playing against 
                    a simple AI which I am still working on and probably 
                    will be for some time , considering trying to use JavaFX 
                    once the AI which should be rather easy to do as once the Back
                    end is completed</P>

                        This Calculator application is built using Python.  The tkinter module is need for the application to work.  As tkinter is used to design the GUI.  
                        Designed this project to familiarise myself with tkinter as tkinker can get pretty complicated but was simple enough for this project.

                        On this project I created buttons for numbers, symbols, screen and body 
                        using tkinter then assigned them to their own functions.  
                    </p>
                    <p class="codeparagraph">

                        I'm happy with this project as it works the way a calculator should with addition, subtraction, multiplication and division functions.  
                        
                        I encountered some problems installing tkinter on linux so I could get this to work on Linux, your usage may vary.

                        Simple Snake game, built in python.    Pygame tracks key presses for movement. This application works using the pygame module.  The snake gets bigger when 
                        eating apples and increases the score, collision detection is used to end the game if the snake gets tangled 
                        in itself. The game also has background audio as well as audio when eating an apple and on collision.

                        MP3 player built in Python.  The following Python modules are used in this project.  
                        Tkinter, pygame, mutagen.mp3, os and time.  
                        Tkinter is used to design the GUI for the application including screen, buttons, status bars as well as message boxes.  
                        Pygames mixer is used for audio playback and mutagen.mp3 is used to track the length of audio.

                        Contains working Play, Pause, Stop, Next Song, Previous song commands.  Can also open a single song using file explorer 
                        adding it to the playlist or can add multiple songs and the playlist can also be deleted.   Also contains a working seekbar allowing the user to skip 
                        to a desired part of a beloved song.  The included Try and except boxes stops the application from crashing if there is no available song to play, 
                        when using previous or next buttons.
